    Vancouver School of Irish Music is a non-profit organization which aims to
    foster a community of traditional Irish musicians and enthusiasts here in
    Vancouver, BC. Our current series of classes is running from April - June
    2025, for children aged 6-12.


    As the school grows we plan to introduce adult classes as well as host concerts and masterclasses from visiting musicians.

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
